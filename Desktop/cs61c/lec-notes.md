### Test

Bits can represent anything!

Unicode came around with code to cover all the world's languages

$n$ bits is at most $2^n$ things; there's only $2^n$ things

### Number vs. Numeral

A **numeral** is a symbol or name that stands for a number: 4, four, quatro, IV, IIII, etc.

**Digits** are symbols that make numerals!

Number is the "idea" in our minds... there is only ONE of these; for example, the concept of "4"
